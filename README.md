# 🔍 Web Vulnerability Scanner 

A lightweight Python-based tool that crawls websites and detects common web vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and more.

📌 This project is for educational use. It demonstrates how basic web vulnerability scanning works and is not meant to replace professional tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP.

## 📌 Project Status

This project is a work in progress.

✅ Core features implemented:
- 🌐 Website crawler using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**



🚧 In development:
- Form detection
- Payload injection (XSS, SQLi)
- JSON report generation
- Command Injection detection
- GET & POST form support
- CLI arguments
- HTML report output

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Crawls** the target site and extracts URLs
2. **Finds forms** and input fields on pages
3. **Injects payloads** (from JSON files) into parameters
4. **Analyzes** responses for signs of vulnerabilities
5. **Generates a report** of findings
