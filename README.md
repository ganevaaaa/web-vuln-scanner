# 🔍 Web Vulnerability Scanner 

A lightweight Python-based tool that crawls websites and detects common web vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and more.

> ⚠️ For **educational and authorized use only**. Never scan targets you don't have permission to test.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Crawls** the target site and extracts URLs
2. **Finds forms** and input fields on pages
3. **Injects payloads** (from JSON files) into parameters
4. **Analyzes** responses for signs of vulnerabilities
5. **Generates a report** of findings
